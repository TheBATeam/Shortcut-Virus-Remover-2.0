# REMOVE SHORTCUT VIRUS FROM LAPTOP
The main reason behind this virus is that it does not simply allow us to **copy and paste** USB data to the computer. Instead of the files, only **shortcuts** get copied and all the original files are hidden inside a special folder in the USB.

Because of this, the programmer inside me got angry. So I decided to make a program to finish this little **annoying virus** off in just one click. I began analyzing the behavior of the **virus file**, and the activity of the **Task Manager**.

Then, I decided to make a USB shortcut virus remover tool – a program to eliminate this virus from my pc. So, I came up with **shortcut virus remover 2.0** with a simple notepad script.

# THE USB SHORTCUT VIRUS REMOVER TOOL
We started working on it. my brother (Namish Kashyap, Who is a designer) designed the simple and flat layout Of the program in order to make it easy and simple to understand. He designed it taking the limited environment of the cmd under consideration.

And I must say, the plugins, those I had created in past – they’ve helped a lot in reducing the length of code from 50 to 60 kb’s worth of a single file to **7 to 9 kb** of the main program file.

The layout of the program seems similar to the **‘Hotspot creator 2.0 by kvc’**, as the basic idea of the design is taken from there. This program can scan for shortcut virus within your system, as well as in a particular drive. When you are scanning the system, then the program will ask you for the action to take with the suspicious files detected.

# HOW DOES THE SHORTCUT VIRUS REMOVER TOOL WORK?
The drive scan option will allow you to scan a particular drive. After **scanning** and performing all operations programs will run an extra operation in this module for the unhiding of the Hidden Files. So, you can see all your data like it was supposed to be.

So, now you can simply **plug-in** your USB and scan it with this program and then you can easily get access to your data.
